<p>This is a small WPF windows app made as a lab during my C# for Windows class in IT Programming at NSCC 2026. The prompt was "Make a WPF app, it can be anything" so I made this.</p>

<p>In this small app, the user can click through a gallery of a tiny handful of influencial women throughout history, and find out a small amount of information about them. The app also provides a link to learn more. The app is kept small due to time constraints, so the list of women is far smaller than history would allow. But the list is ever growing.</p>
